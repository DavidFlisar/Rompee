        <p>Streaming services like Netflix, Disney+, HBO Max, and Hulu offer a vast range of content, but the costs can add up quickly. Luckily, you can stream all of your favorite movies and shows for just 3€ per month by following these simple steps.</p>
        <br>
        <p>First, download Stremio, a free and open-source application available for iOS, Windows, macOS, Linux, Android, and Android TV. Once you've installed it, create an account.</p>
        <a class="btn btn-accent card card-normal h-32 m-3 md:w-2/4 xl:w-1/6" href="https://www.stremio.com/" target="_blank">
            <div>
                <h1 class="font-bold text-2xl">Stremio</h1>
            </div>
            <div>
                <p class="text-base-content font-medium">Download</p>
                <div class="badge badge-secondary m-2">Media Player</div>
            </div>
        </a>
        <p>Next, head over to a website called Real Debrid to sign up for their service. Real Debrid is a torrent storage that hosts and downloads torrents without requiring a server or PC to be turned on. While this service isn't free, it's the only thing you'll need to pay for. You can choose from two payment options: 4€ per month or 9€ for three months. If you opt for the 9€ package, it will cost you only 3€ per month to stream content on all your devices. Follow the link to create an account and make your payment.</p>

            </div>
        </a>
        <p>Once you've subscribed to Real Debrid, you can connect this service to Stremio using a tool called Torrentio. This connection tool enables you to enjoy all your favorite movies and shows on the go. To install Torrentio, you'll need Stremio on your PC and a Real Debrid API, which is provided on the Torrentio website. No account is required to use Torrentio.</p>
